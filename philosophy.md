# Why Serv Exists: A Mental Model for Focused Development

## The Problem We're Actually Solving

Here's the thing about most web frameworks: they make you think about everything at once. You want to add a simple feature, but suddenly you're juggling business logic, route configurations, authentication rules, and middleware—all in your head at the same time.

It's exhausting. And it's unnecessary.

## How Serv Works Differently

Serv lets you work on one thing at a time. Write your business logic without worrying about URLs or permissions. Configure your routes and auth separately. When you change your logic, your routing stays untouched. When you restructure your URLs, your business code doesn't care.

Think of it like this: your business logic lives in one place, your configuration lives in another, and they don't step on each other's toes.

## What This Actually Looks Like

Instead of cramming everything into one place:
```
@app.route('/api/users', methods=['POST'])
@require_admin_auth
@validate_schema(user_schema)
def create_user():
    # Your logic mixed up with framework stuff
```

You get clean separation:
```
def create_user(data):
    # Just the logic, nothing else
    
# Routes, auth, and validation configured elsewhere
# Change one without breaking the other
```

## Why This Matters

When you're debugging a business rule, you don't have to think about routing. When you're adjusting permissions, you don't need to understand the implementation. When you refactor for performance, your API structure stays stable.

It's not about hiding complexity—it's about organizing it so you can focus on what you're actually trying to accomplish.

## The Bigger Picture

This isolation makes everything easier. Collaboration gets smoother because people can work on different layers without conflicts. Debugging gets faster because you know exactly where to look. Even working with AI agents becomes more predictable because they can focus on specific concerns without getting distracted by everything else.

## The Bottom Line

Serv doesn't try to be the most powerful framework. It tries to be the framework that gets out of your way so you can build what you actually want to build, one focused step at a time.# Why Serv Exists: A Mental Model for Focused Development
