# Serv Framework Improvement Planning

This directory contains detailed analysis and planning documents for addressing critical issues identified in the Serv framework. Each category contains specific issue files with detailed analysis, recommendations, and action plans.

## Directory Structure

```
planning/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                     # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ security/                     # Security vulnerabilities and fixes
â”œâ”€â”€ developer-experience/         # Developer experience improvements
â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/                 # Framework architecture issues
â”œâ”€â”€ code-quality/                 # Code quality improvements
â””â”€â”€ organization/                 # Project organization and structure
```

## Priority Order

1. **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL**: Security issues must be addressed immediately
2. **ðŸŸ¡ HIGH**: Architecture and DX issues affecting framework usability
3. **ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM**: Code quality and organization improvements

## How to Use This Planning

1. Start with `security/` directory - address all critical security issues first
2. Move to `architecture/` for foundational improvements
3. Implement `developer-experience/` improvements for better adoption
4. Polish with `code-quality/` and `organization/` improvements

## Status Tracking

Each issue file contains:
- **Problem Description**: Clear explanation with code examples
- **Impact Assessment**: Severity and scope of the issue
- **Recommendations**: Multiple approaches ranked by effort/impact
- **Action Checklist**: Step-by-step implementation plan

## Implementation Guidelines

- Address issues in priority order (security first)
- Create feature branches for each major issue
- Include tests for all fixes
- Update documentation as changes are made
- Consider backwards compatibility for breaking changes

## Dependencies

Some issues depend on others being resolved first:
- Architecture refactoring should happen before performance optimizations
- Security frameworks should be in place before DX improvements
- Code quality improvements can happen in parallel with other work
