# Serv Framework Improvement Planning

This directory contains detailed analysis and planning documents for addressing critical issues identified in the Serv framework. Issues are organized by implementation timeline to prioritize immediate concerns vs future planning.

## Implementation Timeline

### Now (Immediate - Next 1-2 Releases)
Focus on issues that need to be addressed soon to maintain framework stability and usability:

1. **ðŸ”´ CRITICAL**: `now/security/` - Address immediate security vulnerabilities
2. **ðŸŸ¡ HIGH**: `now/architecture/` - Essential architecture fixes  
3. **ðŸŸ¡ HIGH**: `now/developer-experience/` - High-impact DX improvements
4. **ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM**: `now/code-quality/` and `now/organization/` - Quality improvements

### Future (Long-term - Major Versions)
Complex system redesigns and major architectural changes:

1. **ðŸ”µ RESEARCH**: `future/security/` - Complex security system designs
2. **ðŸ”µ RESEARCH**: `future/architecture/` - Major architectural overhauls

## How to Use This Planning

1. **Start with `now/` directory** - prioritize immediate concerns for current releases
2. **Address in order**: Security â†’ Architecture â†’ DX â†’ Quality/Organization  
3. **Use `future/` for planning** - research and design major changes for future releases
4. **Move items between directories** as priorities and timelines change

## Status Tracking

Each issue file contains:
- **Problem Description**: Clear explanation with code examples
- **Impact Assessment**: Severity and scope of the issue
- **Recommendations**: Multiple approaches ranked by effort/impact
- **Action Checklist**: Step-by-step implementation plan

## Implementation Guidelines

- Address issues in priority order (security first)
- Create feature branches for each major issue
- Include tests for all fixes
- Update documentation as changes are made
- Consider backwards compatibility for breaking changes

## Dependencies

Some issues depend on others being resolved first:
- Architecture refactoring should happen before performance optimizations
- Security frameworks should be in place before DX improvements
- Code quality improvements can happen in parallel with other work
