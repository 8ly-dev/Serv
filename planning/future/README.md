# Future Planning (Long-term)

This directory contains complex system redesigns and major architectural changes planned for future major versions. These items require significant research, design, and implementation effort.

## Categories

### Security (ðŸ”µ RESEARCH)
- **03-extension-loading-security.md** - Comprehensive extension security framework
  - Multi-phase implementation (signing, sandboxing, permissions)
  - Requires new security infrastructure
  - Timeline: 4+ weeks of focused work
  
- **05-authentication-system-implementation.md** - Complete authentication system
  - User management, session handling, authorization
  - Major architectural component
  - Timeline: Multiple releases

### Architecture (ðŸ”µ RESEARCH)
- **03-database-integration-system.md** - Database abstraction layer
  - Major architectural change affecting core framework
  - Requires careful API design and migration strategy
  - Timeline: Major version change

## Implementation Approach

These items are categorized as "future" because they:

1. **Require significant design work** - Need thorough research and planning
2. **Have complex dependencies** - May require other systems to be in place first  
3. **Involve breaking changes** - Best suited for major version releases
4. **Need extended timelines** - Multiple weeks or months of focused effort

## Planning Process

1. **Research Phase**: Analyze requirements, evaluate approaches
2. **Design Phase**: Create detailed technical specifications  
3. **Prototype Phase**: Build proof-of-concept implementations
4. **Implementation Phase**: Full development with tests and documentation
5. **Migration Phase**: Provide upgrade paths for existing users

Items can be moved from `future/` to `now/` when:
- Design work is complete
- Dependencies are resolved  
- Timeline aligns with current development priorities
