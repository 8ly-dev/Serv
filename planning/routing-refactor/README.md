# Routing Code Refactoring Project

This directory contains planning documents for refactoring the routing code organization in Serv to improve modularity, maintainability, and clarity.

## Overview

The current routing implementation has grown organically and suffers from several organizational issues:
- Overly large files (`routes.py` at 1,138 lines, `app.py` at 1,112 lines)
- Mixed concerns (HTTP handling, routing logic, form processing all in one place)
- Unclear module boundaries
- Difficult to test and maintain

## Planning Documents

1. **00-current-analysis.md** - Detailed analysis of the current routing code structure
2. **01-proposed-structure.md** - New module organization and responsibilities
3. **02-migration-strategy.md** - Step-by-step plan for refactoring without breaking changes
4. **03-testing-approach.md** - How to ensure we don't break existing functionality
5. **04-implementation-checklist.md** - Detailed action items and progress tracking

## Goals

- **Modularity**: Break large files into focused, single-responsibility modules
- **Clarity**: Clear separation between HTTP, routing, and application concerns
- **Testability**: Smaller modules that are easier to unit test
- **Maintainability**: Logical organization that's easier to understand and modify
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to public APIs

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No file over 500 lines
- [ ] Clear module boundaries with single responsibilities
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New structure is documented
- [ ] Import paths are clean and logical
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
