# Architecture Issues

This directory contains critical architectural problems that affect the framework's maintainability, performance, and extensibility.

## Critical Architecture Issues (🔴 URGENT)

| Issue | Complexity | Impact | Effort |
|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| [Route Class Complexity](./01-route-class-complexity.md) | 🔴 High | 🔴 Critical | 🟡 High |
| [Circular Dependencies](./02-circular-dependencies.md) | 🔴 High | 🔴 High | 🟡 Medium |
| [App Class Monolith](./03-app-class-monolith.md) | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High | 🟡 High |
| [Extension System Inconsistencies](./04-extension-system-inconsistencies.md) | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium |

## Performance & Scalability Issues (⚡ HIGH PRIORITY)

| Issue | Performance Impact | Effort |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| [Route Resolution Performance](./05-route-resolution-performance.md) | 🔴 High | 🟡 Medium |
| [Handler Signature Analysis](./06-handler-signature-analysis.md) | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low |
| [Memory Leaks in Caching](./07-memory-leaks-caching.md) | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low |

## Design Consistency Issues (📐 MEDIUM PRIORITY)

| Issue | Maintainability | Effort |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| [Request/Response Patterns](./08-request-response-patterns.md) | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium |
| [Configuration Architecture](./09-configuration-architecture.md) | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low |
| [Error Handling Inconsistency](./10-error-handling-inconsistency.md) | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low |

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Week 1-2**: Address circular dependencies and Route class complexity
2. **Week 3**: Refactor App class and improve route resolution
3. **Week 4**: Standardize extension system and patterns
4. **Ongoing**: Performance optimizations and design consistency

## Success Metrics

- **Route Resolution**: O(1) instead of O(n) performance
- **Code Complexity**: Reduce cyclomatic complexity by 50%
- **Maintainability**: Clear single responsibility for all classes
- **Performance**: 5x improvement in handler selection speed
