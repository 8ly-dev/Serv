# Security Issues Overview

This directory contains critical security vulnerabilities that must be addressed immediately before the framework can be considered production-ready.

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: XSS Vulnerabilities, Information Disclosure
2. **Week 2**: Missing Security Headers, Input Validation  
3. **Week 3**: File Upload Security, Path Traversal
4. **Week 4**: Authentication Framework, Extension Security
5. **Ongoing**: Configuration Security, Dependency Management

## Security Testing

After implementing fixes:
- [ ] Run security scan with tools like `bandit`
- [ ] Perform penetration testing
- [ ] Code review with security focus
- [ ] Document security best practices for users
