## DX Success Metrics

After implementing fixes, measure:
- **Time to First Success**: < 5 minutes from install to running app
- **Documentation Clarity**: Can new users complete tutorials without external help?
- **Error Recovery**: How quickly can developers fix common mistakes?
- **Feature Discovery**: How easily can developers find and use advanced features?

## Implementation Priority

1. **Week 1**: CLI consistency, getting started guide
2. **Week 2**: Documentation updates, API simplification  
3. **Week 3**: Development tooling, error message improvements
4. **Week 4**: Testing guides, IDE support enhancements
